    <title>Introduction</title>
    <para>
      This article provides details specific to &productnameshort; images that
      are intended for deployment in public cloud environment. Generic
      information about Public Cloud images are provided in the
      <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/public-cloud.html">Public
      Cloud Guide</link>. For other &productnameshort; documentation, refer to
      the

      documentation set</link>.

    <title>Tools involved in initializing &productnameshort; in public clouds</title>
    <para>
      The instance intialization is performed using &ignition; and Afterburn.
      In the default &ignition; configuration, &ignition; is responsible for
      creating the default user: <literal>suse</literal>. &ignition; interacts
      with the Cloud provider instance metadata service only to get so called
      user data. Other data, like the user specified in Azure or SSH key from
      the GCE, are not parsed from this metadata service
    </para>
    <para>
      Afterburn passes the SSH key to the <literal>suse</literal> home
      directory using the instance metadata service (IMDS). To transfer the SSH
      key from the IMDS, the <literal>afterburn-sshkeys@suse</literal> is used.
      The service is started automatically by &systemd;.
    </para>
    <para>
      &ignition; runs on the first boot only. To distinquish the first boot
      from succeding boots, the flag file
      <filename>/boot/writable/firstboot_happened</filename> is created.
      Whenever you want to trigger &ignition; again, you need to remove this
      file.
    </para>
    <para>
      The default &ignition; configuration is stored in the configuration file:
      <filename>/usr/lib/ignition/base.d/base.ign</filename>. You can modify
      this file to perform configuration changes, for details, refer to
      <xref linkend="task-modifying-ignition-cloud"/>.
    </para>
    <note>
      <title>&combustion; not included in the &productnameshort; Public Cloud images</title>
      <para>
        In order to configure your instance with &combustion;, you need to
        create a separate disk in the cloud framework. The disk needs to meet
        the necessary directory structure. Then you need to create an instance
        with this configuration disk attached. If the use of &combustion; is
        needed for integration into your environment you can build your own
        images using keg and keg-recipes. The keg-recipes project contains the
        image description SUSE uses to build the images we publish. For
        details, refer to
        <link xlink:href="https://github.com/SUSE-Enceladus/keg-recipes/">keg-recipes</link>.

  <section xml:id="micro-cloud-disk-size-clouds">
    <title>Required and available disk size</title>
    <para>
      The root volume is set to the size specified byt the cloud vendors, for
      example 10&nbsp;GB in AWS and GCE, and 30&nbsp;GB in Azure.
    </para>
    <para>
      The recommended size for &productnameshort; is 12&nbsp;GB. However, the
      size depends on the number and size of workloads you intend to run.
    </para>
    <para>
      As with each run of the &tr-up; command a new snapshot is created, keep
      in mind that these snapshots also take some size, even though, btrfs
      snapshots are space efficient.
    </para>
    <para>
      The root volume automatically grows as you change the size of the
      underlying disk. When you are running low on disk space, you can always
      stop your instance and make the system disk bigger, up to the limitation
      of individual disk sizes in each Cloud framework.
    </para>
  </section>
  <section xml:id="micro-cloud-snapshots-cloud-vs-slema">
    <title>Snapshotting</title>
    <para>
      &productnameshort; creates its own internal snapshot that are not related
      nor can interfere with the external snapshots of the disk that can be
      created using the Cloud framework tools for backup purposes or to create
      new images. For details about &productnameshort; snapshots, refer to
      <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/html/SLE-Micro-all/cha-snapshots.html"></link>.

  <section xml:id="micro-cloud-registration">
    <title>Registration</title>
    <para>
      After you deploy the image, you need to register the system. In newer
      images, you can use the <command>registercloudguest</command> command to
      register the system. For details, refer to the
      <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-public-cloud/all/html/public-cloud/cha-admin.html#sec-admin-register">public
      cloud guide</link>.
    </para>
    <para>
      Alternatively, you can register your system as described in
      the<link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.3/html/SLE-Micro-all/cha-postintall-registration.html#sec-images-registration">&productnameshort;
      registration</link>.

  </section>
  <section xml:id="micro-cloud-default-users">
    <title>Default users of &productnameshort;</title>
    <para>
      &productnameshort; images comes with a predefined user
      <literal>suse</literal> that has <command>sudo</command> privileges
      assigned. Therefore, you can swith to the &rootuser; using the
      <command>sudo -i</command> command.
    </para>
    <para>
      As the default user probably won't suit your needs, you have several
      options how to add users. Either you can define users in the &ignition;
      configuration file or you can use the <command>useradd</command> command
      to add users to the running system.
    </para>
    <para>
      For details regarding adding users via &ignition;, refer to
      <link xlink:href="https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/html/SLE-Micro-all/cha-images-ignition.html#sec-ignition-examples"></link>
      and <xref linkend="modifying-ignition-cnfiguration-cloud"/>. For details
      regarding using the <command>useradd</command> command, see
