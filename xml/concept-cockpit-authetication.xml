   <para>
    Cockpit enables you to log in directly to each machine that can expose the
    9090 port. This machime is sometimes referred to as the primary server. It is the primary server that runs the <literal>cockpit-ws</literal> through which connections to additional servers are established.
  </para>
<para>
     If the port cannot be accessed on the particular machine, you
    can still use Cockpit to administer the machine by using it as a secondary
    server. For a procedure of adding a server as secondary, refer to
    <xref linkend="sec-adding-servers"/>.
   </para>
   <note>
    <title>A limited number of secondary servers</title>
    <para>
     The number of secondary servers that you can administer from one primary
     server is limited to 20. If you need to administer more servers, add
     other primary servers or use another tool for cluster administration.
