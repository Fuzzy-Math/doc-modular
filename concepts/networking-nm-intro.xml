  </info>
  <para>
  &nm; stores all network configuration as a connection, which is a collection
  of data that describes how to create or connect to a network. These
  connections are stored as files in the
  <filename>/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections/</filename> directory.
 </para>
 <para>
  A connection is active when a particular device uses the connection. The
  device may have more than one connection configured, but only one can be
  active at a given time. The other connections can be used to fast switch from
  one connection to another. For example, if the active connection is not
  available, &nm; tries to connect the device to another configured connection.
 </para>
 <para>
  To manage connections, use the <command>nmcli</command> command, described in the <xref linkend="nmcli-usage"/>.
