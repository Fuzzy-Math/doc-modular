      <para>

  <para>
    RAID is a virtual storage resource using multiple storage devices&mdash;the array, managed by a controller that links one or more computing devices to this array. The devices are presented to users as logical storage resource.

  <para>
    Software RAID uses disk controller software. Most RAID controllers use the SCSI protocol because it can address a larger number of hard disks in a more effective way than the IDE protocol and is more suitable for parallel processing of commands. There are also some RAID controllers that support IDE or SATA hard disks.
