    The purpose of RAID (redundant array of independent disks) is to combine
    several hard disk partitions into one large virtual hard disk to optimize
    performance, data security, or both. Most RAID controllers use the SCSI
    protocol, because it can address a larger number of hard disks in a more
    effective way than the IDE protocol and is more suitable for parallel
    processing of commands. There are some RAID controllers that support IDE or
    SATA hard disks. Software RAID provides the advantages of RAID systems
    without the additional cost of hardware RAID controllers. However, this
    requires some CPU time and has memory requirements that make it unsuitable
    for real high performance computers.
