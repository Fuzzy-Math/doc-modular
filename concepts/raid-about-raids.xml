    Sofware RAID uses a disk controller software. Most RAID controllers use the SCSI protocol, because it can address a larger number of hard disks in a more effective way than the IDE protocol and is more suitable for parallel processing of commands. There are also some RAID controllers that support IDE or SATA hard disks.
